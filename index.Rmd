I am a current graduate student in the [Biostatistics & Data Science](https://hpr.weill.cornell.edu/graduate-education-clinical-training/masters-track/biostatistics-data-science) track in the [Healthcare Policy & Research Department](https://hpr.weill.cornell.edu/) at [Weill Cornell Medicine](https://weill.cornell.edu/). 

I am skilled in R programming. Before my study in WCM, I had been a part-time research assistant at [Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.cas.cn/) for two months in the undergraduate period.
